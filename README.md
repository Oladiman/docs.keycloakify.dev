Why do I need Keycloakify in the first place? Why can't I just implement the default theming system featured by Keycloak?

* Keycloakify lets you use modern frontend technology: TypeScript, React, and any styling solution or component library you'd like, such as TailwindCSS, MUI, ShadeCN/UI, or just plain CSS modules. With the base theming system you have to write [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/index.html) and integrating frontend technologies into a Java Stack isn't straight forward.
* Keycloakify makes it very easy to test your theme inside and outside Keycloak with hot reloading enabled.
* Keycloakify bundles the theme for you into a JAR that you can simply import into Keycloak.
* The Keycloak themes generated with Keycloakify are compatible with all Keycloak versions down to v11, by oposition to regular themes that must be updated to target a specific Keycloak version.
* Keycloakify themes implement real-time frontend validation out of the box. For example, when a user chooses a password that is too weak, they see the feedback immediately and not after they have pressed the submit button.
* We're here to help either via [our Discord](https://discord.gg/kYFZG7fQmn) channel or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify/issues/new).

First thing you want to do is to fork/clode the Keycloakify Vite[^1] starter project.&#x20;

Then you can move on to the next section of the documentation:

{% content-ref url="testing-your-theme/" %}
[testing-your-theme](testing-your-theme/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

[^1]: There's also a Webpack based starter that you can find [here](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter-webpack).
