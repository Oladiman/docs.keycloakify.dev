# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» Quick start

The best way to get started with Keycloakify is to study and play around with the starter project. &#x20;

**The README of the starter repo is the tutorial!** It details everything there is to know and there is a lot of comments in the code to help you figure things out. &#x20;
