Why do I need Keycloakify in the first place? Why can't I just implement the default theming system provided by Keycloak? &#x20;

* Keycloakify let's you use modern frontend technology: TypeScript, React and any styliing solution you'd like such as TailwindCSS, MUI, ShadeCN/UI or just plain CSS modules. Wheas the Keycloak theming system is based on the FreeMarker templating language.&#x20;
* Keycloakify make it very easy to test your theme inside and outside Keycloak with hot reloading enabled.
* Keycloakify bundles the theme for you into a JAR that you can simply import into Keycloak.
* The Keycloak themes generated with Keycloakify are compatible all keycloak Keycloak version down to v11 when regular theme must be updated to target a specific Keycloak version. &#x20;
* Keycloakify themes implements realtime frontend validation out of the box. When user choose a password that is too weak for example they see the feedback immediatly wheras with regular theme they only get the error after pressing submit. &#x20;
* Keycloakify is well documented, well maintained and you're wellcome to join our discord chanell if you're having difficulties. &#x20;
