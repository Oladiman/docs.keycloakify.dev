# ðŸ“§ Email customization

_Introduced in_ [_v4.8.0_](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/releases/tag/v4.8.0)

It is now possible to customize the emails sent to your users to confirm their email address ect.\
Just run `npx initialize-email-theme`.

For this script to work you must be in one of thoses scenario:

* `src/login` or `src/account` exsists, if it's the case it will assume that this is a standalong keycloak theme and create `src/email`
* There is a `keycloak-theme` directory somewhere in your `src` directory. If it's the case it will create `src/**/keycloak-theme/email`.

This directory should be tracked by Git (`yarn add -A`) You can start hacking the default template.

You can remove all the template and resource file you aren't going to customize (it will fallback to the default email theme).  \
When `npx keycloakify` (`yarn keycloak`) is run it will bundle your email theme into your `.jar` file and you will be able to select it in the Keycloak administration pages.
