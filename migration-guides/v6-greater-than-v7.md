### Email theme

The email theme should no longer be at the root of your project in a `keycloak_email_theme` directory.  \
It should be moved to  `keycloak-theme/email`. The `keycloak-theme` dir can be anywhere in your src directory. In the starter project it's at `src/keycloak-theme`

If you experience issues upgrading to v7 do not hesitate to [ask for help](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify/discussions).
