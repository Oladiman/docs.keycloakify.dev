# Component Level Customization

The Keycloakify starter repo doesn't come with much React component at all, this might seem puzling to you but don't wory it will make sense very soon. &#x20;

By default Keycloakify internalize every React component that constitute the default theme and only exposes the \<DefaultPage /> compoent. &#x20;

However you can take ownership of any component that constitutes the default theme. We call this process ejecting. &#x20;

When you eject a page or a temple it will copy from the keycloakify source code into your project the component that you have selected. &#x20;



Under construction, for now see:

{% content-ref url="in-react-components.md" %}
[in-react-components.md](in-react-components.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
