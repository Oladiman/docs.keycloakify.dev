# ðŸ”© Keycloakify in my App

A Keycloakify theme do not need to be a standalone project.\
Under certain conditions you can collocate your React app and your Keycloak theme. This enable to design the Keycloak user facing pages like if they where any other page of your project.  (it's what's implemented in [the starter project](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter)).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently you can only collocate your Keycloak theme with WebPack SPAs. Typically, [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) projects. &#x20;

We are working toward making Keycloakify agnostic to the project it's colocated with.  \
If we pull it off this will enable collocation with Vite, Next, Gatsby... anything. &#x20;

{% endhint %}

Before moving on and setting up Keycloakify in your project, first, mess around with [the starter project](https://github.com/codegouvfr/keycloakify-starter) to familiarize yourself with Keycloakify.

Once you think you are ready to move on:

```bash
yarn add keycloakify
```

add the following script

{% code title="package.json" %}
```json
{
  "scripts": {
     ...
     "build-keycloak-theme": "yarn build && keycloakify"
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

Git ignore the keycloak build directory:

{% code title=".gitignore" %}
```diff
...
/build_keycloak
```
{% endcode %}

That's it. You can build your App as a Keycloak theme with `yarn build-keycloak-theme`\
Reproduce the directory structure of [the starter project](https://github.com/codegouvfr/keycloakify-starter).

You can eject pages using the `npx eject-keycloak-page` command.&#x20;

You might now want to have a look at the available build options:

{% content-ref url="build-options.md" %}
[build-options.md](build-options.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
