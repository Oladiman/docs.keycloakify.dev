## Defining your Terms and Conditions text

There are multiple strategies for providing and updating the therms of conditions of your services pick the one that best fit your usecase. &#x20;

### Using Keycloak Realm Configuration

The default way of defining your terms of services in Keycloak is to provide a message bundle for your realm that overrides the `temsText` key for the different language that are enabled in your realm. &#x20;
