# In Keycloak

Testing your theme in Storybook is nice, but at some point you'll want to test your theme in a real Keycloak instance before shipping it in production.  \
Easy, just install and open docker Desktop then run: &#x20;

```bash
npx keycloakfy start-keycloak
```

You'll be able to select the Keycloak version you want to test with and be provided with a simple link to access your theme. \
